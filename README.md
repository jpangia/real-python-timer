# The First Linux-compatible Timer App That Repeats Its Alarm Sound!
Of the several timer apps I tried available on Kubuntu, all of them suffered from a fatal problem:

THEY DON'T REPEAT THEIR SOUND!!

You start a timer, go do something else, maybe not even looking at your screen...

And you miss the timer, because it makes one tiny little "ding" sound, and then does nothing.

So, anyway, I set out to reinvent the wheel, because I didn't like the wheels I could find.

*Currently a work-in-progress*
-------

# TODO
- bug fix: times caching doesn't work if you typed the values in
- figure out playing sound loop until user input
- implement config: it should include cached time so app can remember where it was when it closed
- installation script

# Dependencies
*coming soooooon(TM)*
# Installation
*coming soooooon(TM)*

# Bonus Features
- timer functionality is all contained in <code>blomp_timer.py</code>, so you could theoretically include it in other projects
