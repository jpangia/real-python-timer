## a note on tkinter events
---
per [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32289245)
the <Enter> event is an event for the mouse entering the widget
the <Leave> event is an event for the mouse leaving the widget
and: "For mouse wheel support under Linux, use Button-4 (scroll up) and Button-5
 (scroll down)"
 for some reason, the button-4 and button-5 events only seem to work when bound to
 the whole window
